# Forest Particles WordPress Theme

Custom Hostinger-ready theme with the textured background, drifting particles, and sample layouts for home, merch, blog, and contact pages.

## What you get
- WordPress theme files (`style.css`, `functions.php`, `header.php`, `footer.php`, and template files for each sample page).
- Reusable particle animation (`script.js`) and texture assets in `/assets`.
- Demo layouts that show how Hostinger/WordPress blocks can sit over the ambient canvas.

## How to install on Hostinger/WordPress
1. Zip the contents of this folder (keep the `assets` directory in the root of the zip).
2. In WordPress, go to **Appearance → Themes → Add New → Upload Theme** and upload the zip.
3. Activate **Forest Particles**.
4. Create pages for Home, Merch, Blog, and Contact. Under **Template** choose the matching demo template (Home uses the default front page, Merch Demo, Blog Demo, Contact Demo).
5. Go to **Appearance → Menus** and assign your navigation to the **Primary Menu** location so the header links populate.

## Assets
- `assets/texture.png` — paper-like texture used in the fixed background.
- `assets/hero.png` — example artwork (optional for your content).

## Notes
- The particle canvas is injected automatically; no extra setup is required.
- The demo cards and lists are placeholders you can replace with Hostinger/WordPress blocks while keeping the styling.
